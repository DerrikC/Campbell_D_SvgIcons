# Campbell_D_SvgIcons
This is a set of environmental sustainability icons. The icons will be scalable and responsive. 
For this project I created 10 detailed SVG icons in illustrator. I added the SVG icons to the html, but I also placed them in an images folder as a backup. I incorporated css transitions that allowed the icons to expand when hovering, and made the button lighter when hovering. I used html, css, and javascript to create a window. I selected elements, and added functions with javascript to allow the window to open and close when clicking.
